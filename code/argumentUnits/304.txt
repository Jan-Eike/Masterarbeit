Do people have a right to self-determination?
Self-determination is a fundamental right that must be afforded to a native or national group.
The oppression and abuse of native peoples by (primarily) colonial powers should be repaired by offering the right of self-determination:
The recognition of minority rights protects cultural identities that risk being diluted:
The state borders drawn (particularly in Africa) by colonial empires took no account of native fault-lines:
Self-determination does not always mean independence:
Being part of a minority (in a democracy where the majority rule) should not secure rights of self-determination:
Calls for independence destabilize countries.
The right to self-determination tends to be framed in the context of de-colonisation, which has long since passed.

Determining who represents a native may make it difficult to decide who is being afforded the right to choose:
The wrongs of the colonial powers are not the fault of modern governments:
The re-drawing of state boundaries is hardly the best way to promote stability in newly independent states:
