Should school students face mandatory drug-tests?
Students who do not break the law by taking drugs have nothing to fear.
In certain circumstances it is better to compromise certain rights in order to uphold other values.
Deterring drug use is the main objective of random drug testing.
Random drug testing will effectively utilize social and peer pressures:
There is a clear and present problem with drug use among teenagers in many countries.
There are many simple methods of drug testing that are not too invasive.
Drug education clearly does not work.
Random drug tests make the school environment better.
Responsibility and obligation to protect.
Drugs are wrong and harmful.
Everybody is equal.
Random tests are ineffective.
Forced drug-testing would violate the principle of innocent until proven guilty.
Innocent students do have something to fear - the violation of privacy and loss of dignity caused by a drug test.
There are means of preventing drug use other than obligatory drug tests.
Forced drug testing will only encourage further rebellion.
Drug users will only turn to drugs that are more difficult to test, such as 'designer' drugs, or use masking agents before being tested.
Education is the ultimate deterrent, not random testing.
Random tests are ineffective.
The government does not have the right to intervene.
It is OK to freely investigate.
The benefits outweigh the costs.
The future benefits should be taken into account too.
