Resolved: Market mechanisms are preferable to regulatory approaches in reducing carbon emissions
Emissions markets are more economical than regulations
A carbon tax is more economical than regulations
A cap-and-trade system better encourages companies to cut their carbon emissions
Carbon tax market mechanisms would be more effective in reducing carbon emissions
It is fair to punish all carbon emissions with a carbon tax:
Emissions standards can give unfair advantage to certain industries
Emissions regulations and standards are a greater administrative burden:
Firms often calculate that non-compliance with regulations is more cost-effective:
Emissions standards are more stable than the carbon markets:
Carbon emissions regulations and standards have proven an effective tool, and can be strengthened if necessary
Command-and-control regulations do create costs that incentivize reductions in carbon emissions:
A carbon tax will not cause drivers to drive less:
Standards target and limit the worst kinds of emissions:
Standards require old generating plants to update equipment:
Taxes unfairly punish innocent consumers of energy:
Emissions markets allow companies to buy the right to commit a social bad (polluting):
Efficiency standards are more popular than market approaches
Companies can easily adapt to heavier efficiency standards:
A carbon tax is less popular and harder to achieve politically
A cap-and-trade system is complicated and entails substantial administrative costs
A carbon market is complicated to explain and introduce into a population:
