Is whaling a good idea? Should the ban on whaling be dropped?
Whales should be treated in the same way as other animals, as a resource to be used for food and other products.
Whale numbers have been revived, opening the opportunity for whaling under sound regulation:
Whale hunting is an important aspect of some people's cultural heritage.
Economic factors favor the resumption of whaling.
Whales are predators that deplete fish stock upon which fishing industries depend:
Modern whaling is humane relative to other animal food processing methods:
Whales are special:
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
We should adhere to a precautionary principle:
Traditional hunting methods are often particularly cruel
Whale watching is now a major industry that justifies the protection of whales:
The decline in fish stocks is due to overfishing by man, not to the activities of whales, many of which eat only plankton.
Whaling is inherently cruel.
