Should governments have the power to intern suspects without trial?
By protecting life, internment is protecting the greatest liberty of all: life.
Internment removes threats from society.
The war on terror is not like past, conventional conflicts, and the executive branch should not be able to take wartime powers simply on its own declaration.
The war on terror is indeed a war with major threats that need protecting against.
At a time when our society is under threat, it is more important to protect our intelligence sources than it is to try and punish individual terrorists.
Internet and tough measures within are aimed only at very few suspects with little major impact.
Although a normal public trial is not possible for security reasons, detainees' rights are still respected.
Continued detention is sometimes elected by detainees over deportation, which makes it ok in these instances.
The war on terror is not truly winnable, making it wrong to intern or detain on the indefinite basis of such a war.
Depriving a person of their liberty without due process is wrong, unconstitutional, illegal, and unAmerican.
Giving the government the power to detain suspects without due process of law will not make society any safer.
Internet is used effectively by terrorists in propaganda and as a recruiting sergeant:
The war on terror has no realistic end-game, making it impossible to define it as a war, which has a definite length.
Rights are needed to protect the few as well as the many, otherwise there would be no need for them in a democracy.
Regardless of the procedures with which internment is dressed up by embarrassed authorities, it is open to abuse because trials are secret with the executive essentially scrutinising itself.
Compromising our usual high standards of human rights encourages bad behaviour by other countries.
