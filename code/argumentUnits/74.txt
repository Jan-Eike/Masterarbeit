A child is more easily susceptible to the wiles of advertisers who seek to inundate them with images of junk food.
Junk food companies would still be allowed to advertise, just not during children's programs.
Many schools are trying to phase out fast food and sodas but many are worried that sales will sink considerably.
Junk food advertising does not force parents to buy the food.
If we apply the principle of individual responsibility, advertising is fine.

Children have little or no money.
