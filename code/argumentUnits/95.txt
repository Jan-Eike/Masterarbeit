Should governments and police units keep a DNA database of criminals?
DNA fingerprinting techniques have considerable advantages over conventional means of forensic crime detection.
A DNA database would not be intended to replace conventional criminal investigation:
The increased use of DNA evidence will minimize the risk of future wrongful convictions.
The use of a DNA fingerprint can scarcely be regarded as an affront to civil liberties.
The creation of a DNA database would not require a disproportionate investment of time or public resources.
There has been an increase in the kinds of crimes being committed that would require DNA testing:
Although DNA detection might have advantages over fingerprint dusting, the test is nevertheless fallible.
There is a serious risk that genetic evidence will be used to the exclusion of material that might prove the innocence of the suspect.
The database is immaterial to the acquittal or exclusion of non-offenders:
The invasiveness of the database resides in the information being maintained on file, rather than in the procedure for obtaining the genetic data.
The initial and continuing expense of a DNA database would be a gross misapplication of finite public resources:
DNA database solves less than one per cent of recorded crimes
DNA testing is commonly irrelevant:
