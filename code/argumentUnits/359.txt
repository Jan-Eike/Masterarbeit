Should Higher Education be funded by a tax on graduates?
A graduate balances both the lures of making education affordable and well funded and thus better:
This proposal would be fairer for graduates as (unlike the repayment charges on student loans) it is a progressive tax, with the level of payment linked to the income of the graduate:
By making higher education free at the point of use it also acts as a social leveller, giving no financial advantage to students whose parents could afford to pay high university fees
A graduate tax would be fairer for everyone in society.
A graduate tax is the best way to increase access to higher education without massively burdening the government with an open-ended financial commitment
The alternatives to a graduate tax are worse:
The prospect of life-long higher-tax status will act as a deterrent to many weaker students who doubt their abilities to make a success of a university degree, or those from poorer backgrounds with no family tradition of higher education:
A special tax on graduates would accelerate the brain drain abroad, as many new graduates would use their university degree (for which they have as yet paid nothing) to find jobs and a higher net income in states without the graduate tax.
As higher earners, graduates already pay a lot more on average in taxes over their lifetime, while consuming less in welfare payments, thus more than repaying their "debt to society":
A graduate tax would be a very expensive scheme to put into effect, as it would require high levels of government spending on student grants before the first graduates began to repay anything through taxation:
There are a number of viable alternatives to a graduate tax as a means of paying for Higher Education:
