Should abortions be limited to 3 months within conception?
If there is to be common ground or compromise, it may be in fixing the point during pregnancy which there is consensus that abortions should be limited.
Any cut-off certainly shouldn't be any later than 3 months:
A woman should certainly should be aware of their pregnancy and can a perform an abortion prior to 3 months.
Laws might offer effective financial incentives, training and penalty provisions.
