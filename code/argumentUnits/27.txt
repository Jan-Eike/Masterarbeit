Should the present international ban on trading elephant ivory be lifted?
Why should human-likeness matter?
Defining sentience is impossible, making it impossible to determine which animals deserve rights or protection:
Even if we could define sentience, how human-like would an animal need to be to warrant protection:
An ivory trading ban actually encourages illegal trading by raising the price of ivory.
Elephant populations have revived, making it possible to lift the ban:
Governments should be able to sell the ivory they confiscate in order to fund their expensive regulation of ivory trading:
The experimental export of raw ivory in 1999 from Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe (conducted under rigorous CITES supervision) was successful in all respects.
Elephants are sentient beings, and are too similar to humans to be subject to killing:
The 1986 ban has reduced demand for ivory:
Increases in elephant populations are only occurring in some places, making the UN ban on ivory trading still relevant:
Storage costs and depreciation are only problems if ivory is stored in the hope of eventual sale.
The 1999 relaxation of CITES controls coincided with a fivefold upsurge in poaching in Kenya and a similar increase in India, as criminals assumed that legal sales would soon be allowed once again.
