Is Web 2.0 citizen journalism having a positive or a negative effect worldwide?
The promoters of Web 2.0 venerate the amateur and distrust the professional.
The world of Web 2.0 is also the world of what Dan Gillmor calls 'we, the media,' a world in which 'the former audience,' not a few people in a back room, decides what's important.
we, the media reflects a desire on the part of Web 2.0 thought leaders to incite a kind of revolutionary Web 2.0 movement that could possibly be defined as reflective of a cult of the amateur:
Wikipedia is committed to amateurism and against the application of credentials:
one of the biggest challenges of today: in our celebration of the amateur, we kind of forget what it means to be professional.
The Web 2.0 undercuts those that innovate, and the benefits that they deserve:
The Web 2.0 allows for too much democracy, trusting too much in the self-regulating side of man:
Blogs undermine a common sense of what is true and what is false:
Sports, porn, and beer are overwhelmingly popular in the blogosphere, and that this is a bad thing:
The Web 2.0 is enabling the pornification of the Web:
Mainstream media has major advantages over blogs in the production of quality content:
The Web 2.0 is a medium for tasteless content and only the elite group is capable of producing culturally valuable material:
Only big media is capable of finding and sculpting prodigious talent:
Unchecked technology threatens to undermine reality and turn media into a rival version of life
this latest, democratized culture, this user-generated content, is actually undermining many of our most valuable institutions, including movie studios, music labels, newspapers and publishing.
Ads are increasingly being wound into or next to content as the primary means of revenue generation, and that the presence of such ads undermines the value of content:
Web 2.0's democratizing and decentralizing effect causes a loss of focused, common culture, which could formally be set by an elite group:
The consequences [of Web 2.0 and certain intellectual property reductions] are the end of professional creativity.
The very anonymity that the Web 2.0 offers calls into question the reliability of the information we receive.

The Web 2.0 amateurs do not distrust professionals, they just compete with them:
The distinction between amateurs and professionals is artificial:
Point that good amateurs are often becoming professionals in their fields, making it impossible to define these two groups as contiguous over time:
A lot of the 'professional' media is staggeringly unprofessional and a lot of amateur media demonstrates professional characteristics, making it impossible to categorize old media as professional and the Web 2.0 as a cult of amateurs:
One cannot pin-down specifically when they become a professional and leave amateur status, that it is, rather, a process of evolving one's knowledge and actions so that they could be characterized as professional:
The Web 2.0 is a much more efficient system than the old model because it removes barriers to entry, making it possible for those with talents or unique contributions to enter the market and be discovered:
Counter argument: consumers demand quality content more than free content, and that this is becoming increasingly so:
Quality content will always rise to the top, regardless of whether it is amateur or professionally created:
Readers are more concerned with their own critique and determination of quality than they are about whether content is free:
Some forums are designed to vet for quality content, while others are designed to allow for voice with few quality controls, and that both have their place; neither is better:
The production of quality-content from Web 2.0 P2P forums depends on how these systems are constructed, that there are good and bad system designs, and that better and better system designs will emerge to help channel the community toward higher levels of content quality:
The advantage of a broader participation is that there is a greater quantity to select quality from.
Individuals are more inclined to commit serious contributive effort to something they are knowledgeable or constructively-passionate about, setting a good stage for quality content creation:
Open-source
There is a Wisdom of the crowd, together we know everything, and that even experts have limited and biased viewpoints:
The new model's long tail allows for everything to be presented and then for a more accurate determination of what is actually popular to be made:
The crowd is becoming increasingly more intelligent, expert, and talented, making decentralizing Web 2.0 technologies increasingly capable of allowing the spotting of such things and their exposure:
Web 2.0 technology is enabling market and democratic forces to be excercised more efficiently, and since these forces are long-term success-stories, Web 2.0 technologies are here to stay:
The free content of Web 2.0 is not very different than the mostly free content of tv, radio, and newspapers; ads are where these business make their money:
The music industry is actually doing fine:
Web 2.0 will not replace other, more traditional mediums of culture and information, but will simply be an addition on top of these mediums:
The fact is that most user-created content on the Web is not challenging the authority of a traditional expert.
