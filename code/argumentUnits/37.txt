Are EU arms sales to China justifiable?
Europe has a developing strategic partnership with China.
The arms ban is an anachronism.
China has changed over the past fifteen years, becoming more open to the world and more open domestically.
The current arms ban is purely symbolic, as China is already able to buy a range of military items from Europe.
Lifting the arms ban will not strengthen China militarily.
In a global marketplace, if the EU states don't sell China arms, others will.
Cooperating with China is the best way to gain influence with the regime in order to promote democracy and human rights
The idea of a strategic partnership with China is both vague and cause for concern.
The European Union should maintain the ban as a continued expression of disapproval for the Tienanmen square massacre and its legacy in modern China.
The arms ban is strategically effective in preventing the Chinese military from gaining access to the best modern technologies.
China poses a threat to regional and international peace and should not be encouraged and helped by European arms sales.
Lifting the arms ban will strengthen China militarily.
Even if it was in Europe's interest to sell arms to China, the damage from upsetting the United States by lifting the arms ban would be much greater.
The European Union is taking a big risk in proposing to lift the arms ban.
