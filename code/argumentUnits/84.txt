Should flag burning as a form of protest be prohibited?
Free speech is and should be limited in many instances.
Flag burning laws should be subject to state-level public opinion and will.
Flag burning does not clearly qualify as an element of speech that should receive freedoms.
The purpose of free speech protection is the advancement of discourse, knowledge, and truth, but flag burning adds nothing to any of these objectives.
Flag burning is a wholly unnecessary means of protest.
The national flag is a symbol of nationhood and national unity that ought to be protected from abuse.
The prohibition of flag burning prevents the breaches of peace that are prompted by such protests.
The law should draw the distinction between the protest and the opinion of the protester.
There is no consistent causal link between flag burning and national security and/or public safety threat (the common justifications for any restrictions on freedom of speech):
To question whether flag burning is an example of free speech is to engage in a futile semantic discussion: The law ought to protect the freedom of expression.
The conduct of flag burning is often necessary to enter the marketplace of ideas.
Flag burning can be a patriotic expression.
Patriotic principles do deserve to be questioned and criticized, making potentially un-patriotic acts of flag-burning (in certain contexts) more acceptable:
The prohibition of an act because it is likely to cause offense or disruption amounts to a heckler's charter.
The law cannot draw any distinction between an act of protest and the opinion it expresses.
