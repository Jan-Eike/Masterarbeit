Should Japan's constitution be amended to allow her a normal military role in world affairs?
Japan has 'paid her dues' on the Second World War.
Countries should be able to govern their own affairs and house a military capability.
Japan needs to be able to protect itself in an unstable region.
Japan has unfairly benefited from its post-war non-military status
Many other countries have offended against humanitarian concerns more recently
The distinction between defensive and offensive capabilities is an absurd one:
Many within Japan deny that much of what she did during the Second World War even happened at all.
Japan's environment will immediately become more dangerous if her neighbours see her re-arming and taking a more aggressive military position.
The international community willingly accepts the burden of having to defend Japan:
Japan actually spends a great deal on her defence now:
Japan's people oppose militarism.
The constitutional restriction springs from the circumstances that led to the governance of Japan being administered by Western powers.
Japan feels herself constrained by the constitutional rule against offensive militarism.
