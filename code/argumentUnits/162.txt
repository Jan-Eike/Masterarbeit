Should reforestation be a central strategy in combating climate change?
Reforestation sequesters C02 and helps reverse global warming
Reforestation can immediately reduce atmospheric greenhouse gases
Reforestation, while not a silver bullet, can help solve global warming
Reforestation is a cost-effective solution to global warming
Enough land for reforestation to be a viable solution
Aerial reforestation cuts costs of reforestation
Reforestation creates financial interest in sustaining forests
Reforestation would have a negligible impact on global warming
Reforestation can result in release of greenhouse gas Methane
Increasing droughts impairs carbon sequestration by trees
Trees only absorb C02 during their growth
Reforestation can increase Earth's Albedo and global warming
Reforestation less cost-effective than reducing emissions
Insufficient nitrogen levels will limit plant growth
