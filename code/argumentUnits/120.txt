What are the pros and cons of algae biofuel?
Algae biofuel is carbon neutral; only emits C02 that it absorbs.
Algae reproduces quickly, maximizing biofuel yields
Algae biofuel can scale to replace oil
Algae biofuel is commercially viable on an industrial scale
Algae biofuel can become price competitive with oil
There are no soil requirements for algae biofuel.
Biproducts of algae biofuels are useful fertilizaers
Algae can be produced locally for food and fuel
Algae biofuel does not damage food prices
Algae biofuel industry growing quickly with bright future
Algae yields much more biofuel per acre than other fuels
Algae photo-bioreactors require very little land
Algae biofuel is biodegradable.
Algae biofuel is a renewable resource.
Algal fuels do not impact fresh water resources.
Algae biofuel can grow in salt water, freshwater or contaminated water.
Human waste and sewage can be used to grow algae biofuel
Algae can filter C02 from coal and be used for biofuel
Algae biofuel is more practical than solar power
Algae biofuel requires less land; good for the environment
Algae does not compete with food resources like other biofuels
Algae requires less fresh water than other biofuel crops
Algae does not require fresh water like other biofuel crops.
Producing algae biofuel requires too much energy
Energy-intensive production of algae biofuel emits greenhouse gases
Algae biofuel distracts from better ways of reducing emissions
Indusrial algae depends on dense C02 from coal
Producing algae biofuel is relatively expensive
Hi-tech algae biofuel plants require too much energy/money
Algae biofuel start-ups exaggerate estimates to attract capital
Algae fuel ponds must be expensively covered
Algae pools can become contaminated and less efficient
Industrial algae biofuel requires too many nutrients
Algae biofuel requires substantial land (expensive)
Algae biofuel requires too much land, harming the environment
Algae biofuel has to be created from scratch
Algae biofuel requires substantial quantities of water
Lining ponds to meet groundwater regulations is expensive
Using algae to filter coal then burning it emits captured C02
Algae from coal ties the biofuel to fossil fuels
Using algae to filter coal emissions is inefficient/costly
Solar power is greener than algae biofuel
Algae biofuel will fail like other biofuels
