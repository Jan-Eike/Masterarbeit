This House believes that hate speech should be a crime
It's easier to prevent a disease, than to cure it.
Hate speech may lead to conflicts and riots and in the end undermine stability in the society.
Even such things as computer games, cartoons and so on, if they contain offensive remarks against other groups, may lead hot only to conflicts within the country, but to international ones.
If someone expresses hate speech in a society in which a response is allowed, then that hate speech, should it lack grounding, would be quickly demolished.
Hate speech does not always leed to violent actions.
These laws are not necessary.
Laws against hate speech can be used in the political sphere.
The cartoons and computer games can't be the root cause of terrorist acts.
We don't know where should the line be drawn with such a piece of legislation.
