Should the Israeli security wall/barrier be taken down?
Israel's security wall was found by the ICJ to be a breach of international law in 2004
Any short term security gain will be offset by growing Palestinian resentment against Israel
Even the Israeli High Court has called upon Israel's government, that it should not provide security to Israeli settlers at the expense of Palestinian rights
The Security wall could weaken the Palestinian position at any peace negotiations as it creates new facts on the ground favorable to Israel that will be hard to reverse
The security wall effectively means the annexation of Palestinian territory by Israel
The route of the security wall is not based on security considerations, but politics
The security wall hinders the everyday activities of Palestinians
By carving up the West Bank, Israel is stopping the development of a workable Palestinian state
The barrier harms Israel's international image and weakens its support in the USA, a crucial ally
There are numerous reasons why the ICJ opinion is not binding for Israel
The Oslo Accord between Israel and the Palestinians says that disputes must be settled by negotiation, not by unilateral appeal to external bodies
The barrier is an effective way to prevent suicide bombers from crossing into Israel and killing Israelis
Israel has a legitimate right to self-defense and to prioritize the protection of its citizens right to life
The security barrier is only temporary and can therefore not affect any peace negotiations
The security barrier merely connects Israeli settlements in the West Bank
The security barrier reduces violence and tensions and subsequently reduces the need for heavy handed and often violent Israeli responses
In time, entry systems will become more routine across the Israeli-Palestinian security border
The Palestinian Authority has to show that it can be trusted to run a viable state before Israel relaxes its security measures
The barrier does not harm Israel's international position
