Should heads of state or members of Parliament/Congress enjoy immunity from prosecution?
Immunity is definite, and holds politicians accountable for their offenses and crimes after office:
The fame and occupation of politicians may make it impossible for them to obtain a fair and objective trial:
Attempts to prosecute senior politicians are very frequently cheap attempts to score political points against them:
Prosecution of a senior politician or parliamentarian damages the dignity of office and functions of democracy:
Immunity allows the politician to remain focused on serving his office effectively:
Immunity actually encourages politicians to break the law.
Politicians are not above the law:
Prosecutions need to be carried out at the time that the charges are leveled due to evidence collection:
Crimes may relate to the office itself, and it is important to prosecute crimes for the purpose of upholding accountability:
With immunity, politicians may be accused unfairly and without the ability to clear their name in trial:
Involvement in legal action does not damage the dignity of office:
Immunity from prosecution would encourage cowardly politics:
Immunity while in office encourages incumbents to try to hang onto office when it might be better for them to leave:
Politicians are elected as responsible people.
Politicians would not break the law from fear.
