Should iron fertilization of algae blooms be part of plans to combat global warming?
Iron fertilization can dramatically reduce C02, combat global warming
Iron fertilization reverses global warming; other solutions only slow it.
Irreversible climate change makes geoengineering unavoidable.
Algae need only sequester C02 for roughly a century.
Trials finding low results from carbon sequestration were faulty
Best practices in iron fertilization can ensure effectiveness
A global iron fertilization plan would cost only around $20 billion.
Ecosystem changes caused by algae are not bad ones
Global warming benefits of algae blooms outweigh ecosystem costs.
Algae blooms last for a short time; no long-term damage.
Growing algae blooms can help feed and revive fisheries.
Iron fertilization would revive depleted phytoplankton populations.
Global warming kills algae, worsens warming; iron fertilization helps
Deep sea iron fertilization would not grow coastal red tides.
Most algae is harmless and understood; red tides can be avoided.
Deep water dieoffs have not been reported after natural algae blooms.
If natural iron fertilization occurs, it is OK for humans to do it
Avoiding iron fertilization is greatest environmental injustice.
Humans are already changing Earth; how can geoengineering be wrong?
Precautionary principle favors solving global warming.
Algae-sequestered carbon may not remain sequestered for long
Algae blooms do not sequester much carbon
Iron-fertilization harms downstream algae, C02 sequestration
Iron-fertilized algae blooms may release some greenhouse gases
Iron fertilization may require an impractical amount of iron
Algae bloom solutions require fertilizing too much ocean area
Verifying carbon sequestered from algae is impossible
Monitoring iron-fertilized algae blooms globally would be costly
Iron-fertilization favors some phytoplankton, destabilizing ecosystems
Iron-fertilized algae blooms deplete nutrients in ecosystems
Iron-fertilized algae blooms can deplete marine oxygen levels
Phytoplankton populations have increased; no need for iron fertilization.
Global warming grows phytoplankton; growing more is reckless
Some plankton species cause red tides and other toxic phenomena.
Sinking organic blooms can render the deep sea anoxic.
Tampering with the environment to solve global warming is wrong.
Iron fertilization is unproven, violating precautionary principle.
