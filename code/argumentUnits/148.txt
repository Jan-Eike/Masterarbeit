Industrial countries caused global warming so should carry burden
India/China can be pressured into joining Kyoto or other treaties

The Kyoto Protocol's emissions targets are economically reasonable
The Kyoto Protocol stimulates new industries
Kyoto does not require we choose between environment and economy
Costs of Kyoto are less than environmental-economic costs of inaction
Opponents of Kyoto are pandering to the energy industry
Government can cut-back on military spending to pay for Kyoto
Markets alone won't reduce emissions; Kyoto necessary
Voluntary emissions schemes do not effectively cut emissions
