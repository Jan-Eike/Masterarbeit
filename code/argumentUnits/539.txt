Should a more proportionate system of voting be used to elect political representatives?
Coalition government breeds strong and sound governance:
Proportional Representation is fairer:
PR results in more engagement in politics as every vote counts:
PR would result in more respect for parliament
Proportional representation and coalition governments are weaker
Coalition government is actually unfair
PR results in less engagement in politics as voters do not get what they voted for
PR would result in less respect for parliament as it means the loss of the constituency link
