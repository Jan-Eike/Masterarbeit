Is the French ban on Muslim veils in public buildings justified?
France has a very low Muslim population.
A ban on veils only applies in public spaces.
If Muslims don't like French policy on the veil, they can move elsewhere.
The ban only applies in public buildings.
French people have Islamophobia; ban on veil softens this problem.
Muslims lose-out in various ways by wearing the hijab (unfortunate, but true).
The Muslim veil is a mark of separation
Islam is not a race.
Religions shouldn't be given preferential treatment by the government.
Wearing the traditional veil is part of Muslim religious practice.
Another Dimension:
Muslim veils cannot harm anyone physically and should not harm anyone emotionally.
The traditional Muslim veil is just a head dress. It is not harmful.
Intolerance of Muslim veils can be cited as racism.
France is depriving Muslims of their religious practice.
