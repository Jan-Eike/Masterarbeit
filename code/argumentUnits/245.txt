Should the justice system focus on rehabilitation over retribution?
Rehabilitation is the more humanizing and dignified objective.
Punishment for punishment's sake (desert) is wrong in a decent society.
Retributive justice replaces the interests of society with ideology.
Rehabilitation acknowledges the reality of social inequity.
Studies show rehabilitation programs are effective.
Prison as punishment does not effectively deter criminals.
Punishment signals clearly that certain conduct is wrong.
Punishment acknowledges to victims that they have been wronged.
Crime is not a product of circumstances; punishment fosters accountability.
Rehabilition programs are not reliable enough.
It is too hard to tell if rehabilitation has worked.
