Is China a threat to international stability?
China is an economic powerhouse, that could dwarf Western nations.
From the middle of the twentieth century, China has presented a formidable military threat.
China acts as a destabilising influence in the East Asian region.
China threatens the Western powers even in the cradle of world democracy, the United Nations.
Just as in the days of the Cold War, China exerts a huge political pull that could allow it to form a dangerous powerblock threatening Western interests.
China's economic growth is unremarkable.
If a country is economically strong, other countries can benefit through trade partnerships.
People wrongly associate a military threat with the Communist political regime, rather than the pacific attitudes of its leaders:
China actually acts as a crucial binding force within a turbulent theater.
China actually has a much better Security Council record than either Russia or France.
For such a large country, the influence that China exerts over other nations is astonishingly small.
