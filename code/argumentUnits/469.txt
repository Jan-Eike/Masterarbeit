Should the United Nations have its own permanent standing army?
The current peacekeeping forces are not enough.
There is need for a professional army.
A standing army is necessary to promote international security
There is a sufficient supply of forces to constitute a standing army
There is considerable political will and support on the part of UN member states
A UN standing army would be independent of the great powers
A UN standing army would be more effective than the troops staffing many missions under the current system.
A UN standing army would bring benefits to the world economy
Although other reforms of the UN may be desirable in their own right,
A UN standing army is unnecessary;
A standing army can threaten the protection of international security
The United Nations does not have the right to create a standing army
The status quo is sufficient to fulfill the UN goal of international security
UN should not turn into a government-like institution.
Differences in language, culture, etc. will seriously mar operational effectiveness,
The cost of such an army would be very high,
If it is granted that the UN currently reacts too slowly to crises,
