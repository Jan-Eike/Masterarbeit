Do non-human animals have rights?
Animals should have rights on the basis that they can think and feel pain.
Human infants and the mentally handicapped don't have many of the capacities that are argued as warranting humans' exclusive possession of rights.
Setting standards such as intelligence for rights has the risk of alienating humans without these characteristics
Our evolutionary attachment to other animals demands that they receive the respect of rights
Many animals do demonstrate an ability to respect the rights of humans?
Cruelty to animals (e.g. bull fighting, fox hunting, battery hen farming) is the sign of an uncivilized society.
The higher complexity of humans warrants that we alone should have rights.
Offering rights to living creatures on the basis of evolutionary attachment is a slippery slope
Animals do not have the ability to enter into social contracts with duties, so they should not be offered any rights
It is perfectly natural to use animals for our own nutrition and pleasure.
It is necessary for humans to use animals as a source of food.
