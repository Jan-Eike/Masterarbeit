Should the international community interfere in domestic affairs at times of humanitarian crises?
Abuse of humanitarian intervention does not disqualify it.
UN has successfully intervened for humanitarian reasons many times.
Rhetoric of humanitarian intervention has been abused historically.
The concept of humanitarian intervention has, almost (if not completely) exclusively, been used as a veil for self-interest
US humanitarian interventions have proven to be atrocities
NATO bombing of Serbia, intervention in Kosovo worsened situation.
[Edit][][][][]Do we need humanitarian intervention to stop the most urgent crises?
The most urgent crisis in the world is starvation and we do not need humanitarian intervention to end that.
