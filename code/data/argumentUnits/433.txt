Is feminism a justifiable political, philosophical framework?
Feminism has no more battles left to fight.
Feminism promotes an unnatural equality between the sexes.
Many feminist campaigns, on issues such as positive discrimination in employment, actually damage the women they claim to help.
By focusing on women and their problems, feminism fails to recognise that there are inequality issues in which men are the victims:
Feminism unfairly represents a small, privileged constituency of middle-class white women, who can afford to worry about relatively insignificant issues like executive pay and body image.
Many women no longer identify themselves as feminists.
Feminism has plenty more to achieve.
Feminism needs to re-evaluate itself as a cross-cultural and global movement.
Aside from physical differences, there are few basic roles in modern societies that can't be performed by both sexes on an equal basis.
Campaigns on behalf of women in particular reflect the feminist contention that women have been unfairly discriminated against for years, and this is likely to continue without positive action.
Women have suffered more inequalities and discrimination - not and that's the point of emphasize underlying feminism.
Feminism could expand its mission, but this does not imply that its current focus is irrelevant or unimportant.
Opponents of the feminist movement have always sought to stereotype feminists in order to reduce their support.
Many of the women who dislike the label 'feminist' turn out to hold what would until recently have been seen as extreme feminist views
