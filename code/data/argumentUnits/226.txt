The display of cultural treasures in western museums is an anachronism based on the false notion that only Western minds can appreciate these treasures:

It is sometimes legitimate for foreign countries to remove artifacts in order to preserve or save them:
War-torn countries are not ideal recipients of cultural artifacts.
