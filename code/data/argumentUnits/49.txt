Should human reproductive cloning be banned and punishments leveled against it?
Human cloning violates the rights of the child to parents
While illegal clones should have rights, a ban is still justified
Human cloning produces sub-humans without ordinary souls.
Scientists want to create a race of clones to experiment on
People want to clone humans for their organs
Cloning technology is unsafe for the resulting life
Human cloning results in the death of many cloned babies
Pushing forward with human cloning violates the precautionary principle
A cloned human would have a diminished sense of identity/individuality
Reproductive cloning generally diminishes human individualism
Human cloning makes individuals replaceable
Cloning plays against God's intentions for reproduction and family
Cloning undermines the natural relationship between procreation and family
Asexual reproduction is sub-optimal for the human species
Human cloning divorces man from nature and natural processes
Reproductive cloning undermines human dignity
Reproductive cloning would entail dehumanizing experimentation
Human clones will be seen and treated by some as inferior
Cloning will lead to eugenics, or the artificial manipulation and control of the characteristics of people.
Dictators will use cloning to produce massive armies.
Cloning evil people will not result in evil clones
Cloning leads to the commodification and manufacture of humans
Human cloning ends do not justify means
Parents that lose a child should not be assuaged with a cloned baby
Reproductive cloning harms the integrity of the family:
Cloning undermines the natural relationship between procreation and family
Cloning treats children as objects:
Parents will suffer identity problems trying to raise a clone.
Human cloning turns the parent into a despot over their child
Cloning will involve the creation of children for predetermined roles.
Human cloning reduces biological diversity in the human population
Human cloning is a threat to the environment in terms of irreversible changes to our nature.
The ends don't justify the means in cloning a child.
By the will of nature/God infertile couples are not meant to reproduce
Human cloning will increase inequalities in society
Human reproductive cloning is unnecessary:
Deformed clones would still be happy to be alive
Cloned humans have a soul and are ordinary humans in every way
Cloned humans should have equal rights
Clones are not good or bad; they have the potential to be either
Clones' quality-of-life depends on how they are received/treated
Cloning is safe enough to perform on humans
Medical advancements once feared are now accepted; cloning is the same
Opponents exaggerate the impact that cloning will have on the world
Cloning does not xerox an individual; all individuals become unique
It is a false requirement that clones possess individuality
Individualism will be maintained despite cloning, as clones will develop their own unique identities:
Moral arguments against cloning are unfair to future human clones
This argument assumes that we know God's intentions.
Human cloning plays God less than lauded therapeutic cloning
Humans have the right to choose to practice cloning
Why is sexual procreation more dignified than scientific procreation?
Cloning will not lead to the mass production of clones
Creating better humans through cloning is a good thing
It is baseless that a dictator would build an army of clones
All parents will not try to clone the same kind of individual
If women have a right to reproduce, society can't say not by cloning
Opponents of cloning must tolerate the practice
Cloned babies would be loved by parents that choose to have them
Parental motives can't be used against cloning and not normal child-rearing
The family integrity argument is wholly unsuited to the modern age.
Cloning is more predictable than natural reproduction
Cloning-reproduction would never compete with sex-reproduction
Human clones will not reduce human biological diversity
Cloning allows gay couples to have children of their own blood
Human cloning would enable infertile couples to have children
The desire to have one's own child and to nurture it is wholly natural:
The American public opposes human cloning
Human reproductive cloning has been rejected by the United Nations
