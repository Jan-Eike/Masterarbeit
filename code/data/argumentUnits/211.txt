Is space-based solar power a good idea?
Space-based solar power is scalable.
Space-based solar power is steady and weather independent.
Insolation is stronger in space than after passing through the Earth's atmosphere.
The concentration of sunlight is easier to achieve in space than on Earth's surface.
Space-based solar power would require only a negligible amount of land.
Lightweight, inflatable structures based on thin film solar cells may be suitable for deployment in space even with current launch systems.
Transmission of the generated power from space to Earth poses a significant technological challenge.
Solar wind would tend to move the solar panels.
Space radiation degrade solar panels.
Large scale deployment of solar panels in space is unimaginable without a major breakthrough in space transport.
Microwave or laser power beam could be used as a weapon.
