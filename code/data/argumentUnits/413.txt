Should the European Union have its own standing army?
It is important for the EU to have a defence policy independent of NATO.
The trend is toward greater European unification on all fronts.
NATO has shown us that a standing multinational defense force is possible.
It is financially feasible.
NATO has successfully defended the interests of Western Europe for several decades now - why rock the boat?
The EU is not on a clear path of convergence on all matters, and particularly not on defense.
A European Defense Force would only approach minor conflicts that are less likely to receive the necessary consensus received by NATO.
Political barriers exist.
