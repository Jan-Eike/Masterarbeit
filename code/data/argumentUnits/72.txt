Should there be a worldwide ban on the use of driftnets to catch fish?
Drifnet by-catch has a disastrous impact on ocean life
Driftnets can push a targeted species to extinction
Large-scale commercial driftnets are the concern, not local driftnet use.
An effective driftnet ban must go beyond international waters into countries' Exclusive Economic Zones.
By-catch doesn't need to be a reason to ban driftnets.
The reports of extinction through over-fishing are inconclusive and based on anecdotal evidence.
Driftnet fishing is a form of subsistence living for many.
There is a ban on the use of driftnets in international waters already.
