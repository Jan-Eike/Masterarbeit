What are the Pros and Cons of Thorium based nuclear energy?
Thorium does not require enrichment to be used as a nuclear fuel.
Thorium is much more abundant in Earth's crust than Uranium.
LFTR reactor can be operated continuously.
LFTR reactor operates at high temperatures.
LFTR reactor operates at low pressures.
Nuclear waste produced by LFTR is relatively short-lived.
LFTR produces much less nuclear waste than PWR.
LFTR has the potential to utilize existing nuclear waste as a fuel.
LFTR reactors can be designed to be self-regulating.
Thorium waste is less radioactive than Uranium.
Making nuclear bombs with Thorium is harder than with Uranium.
Switching nuclear infrastructure from Uranium to Thorium is hard.
Molten fluoride salts are highly reactive.
Reprocessing Uranium-233 to make Thorium is challenging.
Any radioactive fuel, such as Thorium, carries risks.
