Do people have a right to die and even to commit suicide?
Of course there exists the right to live.
People are free to commit suicide as it only harms them.
Decision to commit suicide does not demonstrate insanity
Die with dignity, abandon the word euthanasia
Right to die annoys power-freaks
Suicide violates the value society places on life.
Prescribing lethal drugs is violation of the doctor's healing role
