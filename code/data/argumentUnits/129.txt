Should corn ethanol be emphasized in the fight against global warming?
Corn grown for ethanol acts first as a carbon sink
Corn ethanol burns cleaner than gasoline
It requires less petroleum to produce corn ethanol than gasoline
Corn ethanol energy produces a net energy gain
Relative to gasoline, corn ethanol has a good net energy gain
Expansion of corn ethanol industries is increasing its viability.
Ethanol is economically beneficial
Corn ethanol is competitive against high oil prices
Ethanol is a means to reducing foreign oil dependencies
Corn ethanol is a good local replacement for oil
Corn ethanol is merely a part of the equation in replacing oil.
Corn ethanol production is becoming more efficient relative to gasoline
Corn ethanol has a positive effect on air quality
Corn feedstock is a beneficial byproduct of corn ethanol production
Making ethanol from corn does not deprive the needy of food
Corn requires less water than many other crops.
Corn ethanol is energy efficient
Many race cars run on corn ethanol:
Modern engines have been made ethanol-compatible
Corn ethanol acts as an antifreeze in the wintertime
Ethanol-blended fuels are approved under many auto warranties
Corn ethanol is an immediate alternative fuel solution.
Rural people have high hopes for corn ethanol
Ethanol energy is a net CO2 polluter
Corn ethanol incentivizes deforestation, contributing to global warming
Corn ethanol cannot compete with oil:
Ethanol energy involves a net loss of energy
Transporting ethanol requires substantial ethanol
Uncertainty regarding net energy of corn ethanol is troubling.
The corn ethanol boom is driven by political propaganda
High demand can increase corn ethanol and gas prices
Ethanol energy does not get good fuel-economy with standard engines
Corn ethanol cannot scale
Corn ethanol production costs too high despite investments
Corn ethanol will not be a significant substitute for oil
Corn ethanol production demands too much oil to lower oil dependencies
Corn ethanol damages air quality and causes respiratory illnesses
Corn ethanol contributes to soil erosion and runoff
Corn ethanol increases the price of corn and related foods
Producing corn for ethanol requires too much water
Corn ethanol production damages water quality
Corn ethanol is less energy efficient than regular gasoline:
Sugar ethanol yields more energy and power than corn ethanol
Ethanol fuel is bad for engines
Most engines are compatible only with ethanol mixed with gasoline.
Corn ethanol is inferior to sugar ethanol
