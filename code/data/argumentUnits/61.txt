Should children be allowed to work in the performing arts or professional sports?
If children are working or performing they are not spending their time in formal education.
Children are less able to make decisions for themselves and to represent their interests.
Stage fright and the pressure of performance can be difficult to handle for even the most experienced adults.
Young bodies are not well protected against the rigors of regular physical training.
Allowing children to perform pushes them to grow up too soon.
The consequences of such a ban need not be severe.
A bit of work and performance is important for children in giving them a taste of real life early on.
Banning child performance will not prevent the possibility of exploitation; it will merely place it out of reach of scrutiny.
Children feel pressure to succeed in many fields, not simply in performances.
Children's bodies can be damaged by many forms of physical performance.
Children have had to mature rapidly for ages; child performance fosters this.
The wider consequences of a ban on child performers will be severe.
