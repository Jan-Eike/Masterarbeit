Is it ever right for Governments to restrict freedom of speech?
Speech acts lead to physical acts.
Free speech is an inherently ambiguous concept that requires definition and interpretation; Government is the obvious place for such clarifications to be made.
Some intellectual views are antithetical to beliefs held by major religions, and should be protected against.
Government must protect its citizens from foreign enemies and internal enemies.
Irrespective of its US provenance, we recognise that the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic.

The link between speech acts and physical acts is a false one.
Exposing bad views by allowing them to be voiced increases the likelihood that they will be defeated.
Governments cannot be trusted as arbiters of free speech; it is a God-given and inalienable right.
Allowing government censorship threatens to allow a tyranny of the majority.
Although some views may be expressed that might are contrary to religious teaching
Why give special treatment to dissenting religious groups?
The ends justifying the means is a common pit-fall of allowing governments to suppress freedom of speech.
