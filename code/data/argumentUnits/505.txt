Is the HADOPI law in France a good idea?
Graudated response is the least draconian option.
Graduated response would only temporarily cut-off Internet.
Suspending Internet access for file-sharing is draconian.
Small fee for piracy more proportional than disconnection.
HADOPI violates human right to Internet access.
Cutting off access does not mean individual can't get online.
