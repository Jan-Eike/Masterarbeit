Is Christianity compatible with Jewish culture and tradition?
If Jesus was not the messiah, then who was he?
That Jesus fulfilled many old Testament prophecies in his 33 year lifetime is fairly obvious.
The Jewish scriptures make it clear that there will always be a descendant of King David on the throne of Israel.
The messianic prophecies clearly apply to Christ and none other.
