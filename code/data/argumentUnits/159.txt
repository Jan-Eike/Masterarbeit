What are the pros and cons of T. Boone Picken's US energy plan?
The Pickens Plan will stimulate the US economy
Pickens makes beneficial long-term investments in electric grid
Pickens Plan provides a good test case
That the Pickens Plan is for profit is a good thing
Wind energy is a renewable resource than can replace coal.
Pickens Plan wind turbines will produce significant energy
Pickens Plan is feasible application of wind technology
Inconsistent wind energy in Pickens Plan can be accommodated
Wind energy frees up natural gas to be used in cars.
Pickens wisely replaces oil imports with domestic natural gas
Natural gas vehicles reduce emissions, fight global warming
Natural gas burns more cleanly than gasoline in general
Existing gasoline vehicles can be converted to cleaner natural gas.
Pickens Plan exploits abundant US natural gas resources.
Natural gas is about half as expensive as gasoline.
The natural gas infrastructure already exists.
It is relatively cheap to convert existing cars to natural gas.
The Pickens Plan is generally a good idea
Pickens energy plan is very expensive
Pickens Plan requires infeasible electric grid upgrades
Pickens Plan favors technology over better market guidance
Pickens Plan relies too heavily on subsidization
Replacing natural gas with inconsistent wind energy is unwise
Wind energy production is inconsistent relative to demand
Wind energy is non-dispatchable
Better ways to cut oil consumption than Pickens Plan
Wind energy production is often too far from demand
Pickens Plan wrongly diverts natural gas from replacing coal
Renewable vehicles better than Pickens' natural gas cars
Pickens Plan for natural gas vehicles will increase gas prices
Pickens plan use of natural gas vehicles is unwise
Wind requires natural gas back-up (contrary to Pickens)
The Pickens Plan is generally not viable.
