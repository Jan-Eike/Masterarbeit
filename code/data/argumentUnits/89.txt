Should the government take actions to deter individuals from smoking?
Cigarettes are harmful; governments should take action against them.
Smoking is not a real choice, as nicotine is an addictive drug:
Most smokers want to quit; restrictions do them a favor.
Cigarette makers should pay a price for creating harmful products.
Smoking forces others to 'passively smoking':
Cigarettes and many illegal drugs are similar
Harm of cigarettes are cause enough for restrictions on ads.
Governments must defend freedom of choice to smoke.
A comparison of tobacco to hard drugs is inaccurate:
Many things are addictive; alienating tobacco is unfair.
Cigarettes are very different from dangerous cars or poisonous foods:
Many products are unhealthy; alienating cigarettes is unfair.
Restricting smoking, done by billions of people, is unreasonable.
Evidence about passive smoking is dubious.
Passive smoking can be reduced without draconian restrictions.
Ads do not force people to smoke.
Neuromarketing study claims these ads are counterproductive.
