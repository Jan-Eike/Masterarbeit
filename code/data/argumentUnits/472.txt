Is mass migration, especially from developing to developed countries, a good force?
Free, market-driven migration leads toward a higher net productivity of labour in the world:
Remittances benefit home economies:
Home country save on health care and other social benefits because they are spent on a migrant by his host country.
International migration can bring new knowledge and technologies to some countries.
Inflows of low-paid migrants lowers the need for outsourcing:
Immigrants are mainly of working age, which means they consume less of the services provided by the state, such as health care and education, and pay more in taxes:
International migration is beneficial because it brings workers to where infrastructure and knowledge are:
People smuggling is now a massive illegal operation
Many would-be migrants die taking desperate risks in an effort to reach their goal
Many countries are taking increasingly expensive and illiberal measures to enhance their border security, with a negative impact upon trade and legitimate travel.
Many studies show that most migrants would prefer their stay in the developed world to be temporary, but their illegal status deters them from visiting and maintaining contacts at home, so their stay becomes permanent.
Contention that wealthy countries benefit most from migration (and need such benefits least), whereas poorer countries lose out:
Often migrants move with their families, so there cannot be any income for a home country.
The success of immigrants in boosting the American economy was only possible thanks to a huge internal free, liberal market there at the time, and the plentiful availability of cheap land.
What is good for poor countries and the global economy is sound trading practice and investment in Less Developed Countries.
Unless borders are thrown open completely and total freedom of movement is allowed, there will always be attempts to enter countries illegally, with unpleasant consequences.
