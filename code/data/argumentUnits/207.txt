Should the United States Congress allow drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge?
The area in the ANWR under consideration for drilling is relatively small
Technology has substantially reduced the environmental 'footprint' or impact of arctic oil development
Drilling would only be done in the winter months.
Wildlife has not been notably harmed by other drilling projects in Alaska
The ANWR drilling area under consideration is a baron land with little to protect
US ANWR production methods are cleaner than foreign methods, which are the only supply alternatives
Wildlife refuges typically allow for limited drilling projects
The effect of oil spills has only local effects
Drilling in ANWR would increase US GDP
Drilling in ANWR is a necessary means to reducing energy prices that are damaging the US economy and consumer
Drilling would create a substantial number of new jobs
ANWR drilling would result in many trickle-down economic benefits
Federal tax revenues would increase as as a result of drilling in the ANSWR
The US needs a diversity of energy sources involving green energy AND ANWR oil
ANWR has substantial oil reserves and is an important resource to tap
US domestic oil supplies are severely limited and create vulnerabilities that ANWR can help alleviate
Investing in green energy is not a solution to current US oil demand
Drilling in ANWR would help reduce the large US budget deficit
Drilling in ANWR is an essential part of reducing US foreign dependence on oil
A clear majority of Alaskans support drilling in ANWR
Many of Alaska's native tribes support drilling in ANWR
Increasing oil prices will increase pressure to drill in ANWR

The Bush administration has made drilling in the ANWR a major part of his energy policy since 2002.

Prudhoe Bay's example demonstrates the risks of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
Drilling in ANWR would risk major oil spills and environmental harm
ANWR would require an infrastructure that would be environmentally invasive
ANWR drilling would harm polar bears
Drilling in ANWR would harm bird habitats
ANWR oil drilling would harm ANWR caribou
Drilling in ANWR will threaten muskoxen
ANWR oil drilling will lead to the exploitation of other protected areas
Many job-creation estimates are highly exaggerated
Job-creation would be better achieved by investing in green energy
Economic interests should not justify the exploitation of protected areas such as ANWR
Added oil supply from ANWR would be a drop in the bucket for US consumption
The relative insignificance of ANWR oil supplies makes it a poor means to reducing US foreign oil dependencies
Drilling in ANWR would have a negligible effect on oil prices
Oil from the ANWR would not be available for a long time
Drilling in ANWR would only perpetuate the US addiction to oil
Reducing US foreign oil dependence would be best achieved through investments in green energy technology
ANWR drilling is opposed by the majority of tribes in Alaska
A clear majority of Americans oppose drilling in ANWR
