Is carbon capture good technology and investment?
CCS can dramatically slash emissions from fossil fuels
CCS makes continued dependence on hydrocarbons cleaner
Burning biofuels and burying emissions can lower atmospheric C02
CCS can be widely deployed on existing, huge energy sources
Carbon capture and sequestration is one part of larger climate fight
CCS is valuable even if years away
CCS can be used to draw carbon directly from air.
Sequestered carbon can be stored at ocean floor.
CCS can ensure that buried carbon will stay there
General statements in favor of carbon capture and storage
Risks of stored C02 leaking is very low
C02 would leak too slowly (thousands of years) to be a concern
Sequestered carbon can be stored over the long-term.
Sequestered C02 can be injected into reservoirs to recover oil
CCS doesn't have to be profitable to be a good idea
CCS will become cost-effective as it scales
Carbon can be captured and stored, beneficially, in cement.
Algae CCS produces valuable bi-products.
Many companies are investing in CCS voluntarily.
Coal electricity still cost competitive even after CCS costs.
Renewables better than CCS and dealing with carbon waste
CCS delays inevitable transition to clean energy
CCS requires significant energy; is inefficient
CCS distracts attention and resources from clean energy
Carbon capture and sequestration is greenwashing for coal
Carbon capture and storage is smoke-and-mirrors tactic for big coal
CCS will take far too long to implement for climate change
Capturing/transporting/storing billiions of tons of C02 is not feasible
CCS coal plants emit less CO2, but more pollutants
Climate change is best solved by energy efficiency, not CCS
Leakage of C02 from storage sites is a risk
CCS passes C02-leakage problem to our children
Ocean sequestration of carbon has negative effects.
Taxpayers would be on hook for CCS leaks
Carbon capture and storage cannot scale cost-effectivley
CCS is less cost-effective than renewable energy
Carbon capture and sequestration raises costs and energy prices
Without a price on carbon, CCS will not spread
The transportation of captured carbon can be very expensive
Carbon capture and storage requires significant water
Cheaper cleaner natural gas will smother carbon capture and storage
