Should doctors be allowed to prescribe contraception for girls under the age of 16?
To presume that girls, or young people in general will be prevented from experimenting with sex if they are denied contraception is ludicrous:
It is imperative to provide sexually active underage women with contraception, because they are most likely to be promiscuous:
Providing contraceptives to sexually active children provides an opportunity to educate:
Children should not be expected to abruptly change their attitudes and behaviour toward sex and contraception-use at the turn of their 16th birthday.
The role of the doctor incorporates a responsibility to his/her patient.
The government cannot allow for the provision of condoms to youths, such that it implicitly condones breaking the law:
By effectively condoning sex through the provision of contraception, we condone further sexual activity and risks:
The issue of the health of the girl must also be considered:
Legalising the prescription of contraception will not prevent the problem of teenage pregnancy:
The role of sex education and provision of a moral framework is the responsibility of the parents.
