This House believes that laughter is the best medicine
Laughter is (virtually) for free
Anyone can laugh, (almost) anytime
Laughter is renewable and sustainable
Laughter leaves no high toxic waste
The sound of laughter fades quickly
Only conscious people can laugh
Laughter is noisy
Laughter overdose may result in a serious injury
