Should outside nations intervene militarily in crisis/war in Chechnya?
The scale of the civilian damage created by the attacks of the Russian army and the lack of justification produced creates a humanitarian imperative.
Without action to oppose the attacks on innocent civilians in Russia it is impossible for the International community to set any kind of line on human rights abuses and aggressive military force.
The Chechens have a legitimate claim to nationhood.
The Russian government can be persuaded to accept intervention and a brokered agreement.
EU and UN forces have demonstrated their effectiveness in other fields.
Counter that this implies a moral obligation to intervene in all conflicts where civilian casualties occur.
Russia will use its veto in the security council to attempt to block any human rights-based intervention in Chechnya.
A distinct culture does not automatically confer the right to sovereignty.
The Russian government has never and will never accept the incursion of foreign power.
The attempt to establish safe havens in Bosnia was a disaster that led at least indirectly to the Srebrenica massacre.
