Should the US maintain landmines in the KDZ b/w North and South Korea?
Deterrence prevents North Korea from invading South Korea (not mines)
Mines are not essential to deterring N. Koreans.
North Korea's tunnel network under DMZ undermines landmines.
Mines in DMZ controlled by S. Korea; unaffected by US joining.
Landmines are not protecting US troops as first line of defense.
S. Korea military superior to N. Korea; mines unnecessary.
Landmines inhibit a counter-attack into North Korea
Landmines in N. Korea are a threat to civilians.
North Koreans will think twice
Defending against North Korean blitzkrieg requires landmines
Landmines in Korea would slow down invasion, thin enemy ranks.
Landmines in Korea would force attackers into vulnerable territory.
W/o mines more US troops would be needed in South Korea.
Casualties in repelling N. Korean invasion would be higher w/o mines.
Landmines in the Korean DMZ do not threaten civilians
Removing landmines from the DMZ harder than no new mines.
Korea is the sole exception requested by US to mine ban.
