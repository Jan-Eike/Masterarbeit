Should the ban on exploiting the resources of the Antarctic be maintained?
Antarctica is a pristine and unspoilt continent of great scientific value:
Antarctica presents an alternative to a world dominated by political disputes, economic exploitation and environmental destruction, and we should preserve it that way:
There are many reasons why oil and gas exploration should not be allowed in the Antarctic:
Antarctica must be protected from mineral exploitation and the 1991 Protocol upheld:
Fishing is at present allowed under the 1991 Protocol
Access to Antarctica should be restricted to those with a serious scientific purpose:
There is not much worth preserving in Antarctica; it's a nearly uninhabited desert:
Any negative effects of exploitation would pale in comparison to other negative environmental activities going on around the world:
It is inappropriate for a scientific elite to set the agenda in closing off Antarctica, without regard to either economic logic or democratic accountability:
Oil exploration in Antarctica is now feasible, should be allowed.
The Antarctic Protocol of 1991 should be amended to allow for the possibility of mineral prospecting:
Fishing in Antarctica provides a crucial source of protein to populations, particularly the poor:
The Antarctic oceans are underexploited compared to all other fisheries:
Tourism should be greatly expanded to allow as many people as possible to visit this unique environment:
