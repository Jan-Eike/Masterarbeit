What are the pros and cons of extracting oil from "oil sands"?
Hydrocarbons required in forseeable future, including oil sands

Oil sands require too much water to be sustainable.
Tar sands cannot compete with low-prices of OPEC
Oil sands can't compete w/ cleaner, abundant, cheaper natural gas
Tar sands emit far more greenhouse-gases than even petroleum
Making oil sands as clean as petroleum is insufficient
Tar sands worsen climate change; better to invest in clean energy
Tar sands perpetuate oil dependencies, delay clean energy
Oil sands are a symbol of addiction to oil
Oil sands take more energy to extract, so emit more
Significant gas is used/burnt to extract oil from sands
Forests are cleared for oil sands, destroying carbon sinks.
Oil sands help Canada far exceed Kyoto emissions limits
Carbon sequestration cannot be relied on for oil sands
Oil sands are one of the dirtiest fuels available
Washing tar from sands forms highly polluted ponds
Oil sand mining and rilling destroy pristine ecosystems
Forests are often stripped in the production of oil sands
