Should the government give more funding to schools with higher academically achieving students?
Schools with students who do well deserve a good education and better chance in life.
Schools do want extra funding and providing money to high achieving schools would provide an incentive to do well.
Lower achieving schools need the money more.
Lower achieving schools often are situated in small, disadvantaged commmunities. These are the kinds of schools that need more funding.
Schools can always unfairly tamper with results given to the government.
Higher achieving schools need funding and money to give quality education. The incentive would be out of reach.
