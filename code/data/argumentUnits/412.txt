Should the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy be scrapped in favour of free trade?
The CAP is an outrage for consumers!
The CAP is also unfair for many states in the EU.
Since the amount of food on the market is kept small, and the market is closely controlled, farmers are able, under the CAP, to produce bad quality food without penalty.
The EU is set to expand.
The advantages of deregulation have been demonstrated in Australia and the Far East where food prices have dropped and the quality has risen.
Unemployment among farmers is an acceptable price to pay.
The CAP causes environmental problems
The money spent on CAP does active harm.
The CAP preserves a European model of agriculture.
It is necessary for the EU to support its least efficient members.
The CAP reduces the amount of food on the market to prevent wastage
The CAP may have to be altered slightly to accommodate new members, it does not have to be scrapped entirely.
The EU's main rival is not Australia or the Far East but the US.
This would cause enormous unemployment among farmers
In addition to unemployment the domination of multinational agriculture would lead to much greater environmental damage than is caused by the CAP.
For the reasons explained above, the CAP is a worthwhile way to spend EU money.
