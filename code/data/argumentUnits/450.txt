Should fat air passengers be charged extra for their extra weight?
They charge a lot for excess baggage, there isn't a difference.
Both give extra weight.
The cost doesn't just cover fuel.
If you do the maths, some excess baggage fees cost more than the actual flight!
Of course it would be.
That is discrimination.
Most people weigh under the standard weight and their payment for a larger expected weight would cover the cost for overweight people.
A fat passenger who flies regularly would really suffer.
There is no comparison between a person and a suitcase.
Airlines spend a lot of money to run services.
If customers choose to have too much luggage, that is the customer's fault.
It is not the airline's fault that people are fat. The extra fees are necessary to cover extra costs.
