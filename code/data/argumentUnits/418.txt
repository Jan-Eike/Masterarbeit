Should Scotland become an independent nation?
There are many things that Scotland retains, which are distinct from England, and which can be argued as important factors that favor an independent Scotland:
A unique, distinguished history, which included independence from England:
Geographic distinctions:
Distinct culture:
Separate state functions:
Separate legal:
Separate banking system:
Separate education system:
A dialect that is unique from England's:
These all contribute to a general Scottish identity that is distinct from England:
The difference in voting patterns between the Scots and the English unfortunately mean that the latter have more say than the former regarding the formation of British governments in general elections.
Assertion that many principal Scottish interests are not upheld in the current arrangement:
Some sources argue that it may no longer be very valuable in today's Europe to maintain economies of scale in larger unions for the sake of pooling resources for funding a stronger military.
Scotland has all the trappings of an independent nation
The British are not really subsidizing the Scottish.
An independent Scotland may benefit economically from the reduced English exploitation of Scottish natural resources, which may be disproportionately used for the benefit of England:
Scotland may not be hindered by its relatively small size in order to exist as an independent nation.
It also seems unlikely that an independent Scotland will not be a member of NATO and/or form a military alliance with England.
Independence will better enable Scotland to specialize, which is very important in the free-market world:
England may benefit from its reduced subsidization of Scotland, and greater potential to specialize its own economy:
Argument that many countries in the world have strong regional differences that have not justified separatism:
Argument that Scotland receives sufficient proportional representation in the UK voting system:
Argument that the 1997 devolution of power to Scotland has given them sufficient power and control to exercise their interests:
The Scottish Parliament is more of a regional assembly than a national legislature.
Argument that and independent Scotland would lose the benefits of UK subsidies:
As part of the larger UK, Scotland would be able to better protect its interests from an increasingly federalizing EU:
The economic effects of independence would be impossible to predict, making it a poor point to use in favor of independence:
The economic impact would be irrelevant:
By remaining part of the UK, Scotland may benefit from economies of scale accompanying this union:
Could spark sessions and instability in other parts of Europe:
