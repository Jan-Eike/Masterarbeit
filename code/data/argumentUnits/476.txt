Is it correct for university authorities to ban hate speech?
Free speech is one of the founding principles in a democratic society and should be upheld at all costs.
The best way to combat hate speech is by speaking out against it!
The rights which we enjoy in democratic countries also come with responsibilities.
Since the mid 1980s there have been a series of violent incidents, incited by hate speech, directed at various minorities in university.
