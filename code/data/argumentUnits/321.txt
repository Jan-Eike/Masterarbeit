Should Britain give up its annual rebate on its payments to the European Union?
The EU-UK rebate is an undeserved exception.
UK rebate no longer justified; UK economy stronger since negotiations
Ending rebate will help stimulate EU agricultural reform.
The UK rebate is fair; UK's contributions to EU CAP are outweigh benefits.
The rebate could never be regained, if lost.
Giving up the UK rebate is unnecessary in achieving serious EU-CAP reform.
