Should countries place some limitations on foreign investments?
Economic growth is best when it comes from within.
Putting a cap on foreign investment and so reducing the likelihood of a bubble economy developing acts as a spur to local investors to invest their money in the home economy.
The system is flexible and so can meet needs as they change throughout the economic cycle.
A cap would insulate the home economy from the extremities of the global economy.
A cap acts as a disincentive to swift withdrawal of funds.
A cap sends a clear message to the world that a nation is serious about preserving its interests.
Limiting foreign investment protects the national interest.
A cap would reduce foreign investment, which is critical to economic growth.
The message a cap sends out will scare off investors.
Regulation would impose new transaction costs. Policing the limit would cause delay and cost money.
Trade and openness is in the interests of countries.
A cap would raise the cost of capital and so slow the economy.
Any cap may be subject to challenge or reciprocation by other countries.
The whole idea of investment curbs affronts the ideal of the free market.
