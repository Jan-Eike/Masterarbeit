Does fusion power represent the future of energy generation?
No chain reaction is involved.
There is no possibility of a catastrophic accident
Although failure of the reaction chamber is possible, simply stopping fuel delivery would prevent any sort of catastrophic failure.
Radiation risk is small.
Muon catalyzation would bring the temperatures at which fusion can occur down
Fusion does not produce any GHG emissions.
Fusion produces less waste than fission.
No transport of radioactive materials is required
Prototype tokamak fusion reactor proves successful.
The transformation of kinetic energy of neutrons to electricity is a complicated process
Tokamaks could explode outward.
Radiation risk.
There is no known way how to efficiently produce muons
