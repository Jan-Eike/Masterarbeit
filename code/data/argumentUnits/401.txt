Should we reverse the flow of the Chicago River?
There are other, cheaper ways to prevent the carp from invading and the barrier would not necessarily help.

Commercial fishing and tourism industries would be hurt by erecting barriers as well as recreational boating. Costs of this inefficiency would be passed onto consumers.
Sewage/Wastewater flowing back into Lake Michigan instead of down the Mississippi River
Asian Carp have a low probability of destroying the Lake Michigan ecosystem.
