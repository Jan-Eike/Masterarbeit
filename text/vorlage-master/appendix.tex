\section{Discarded Ideas}
We tried a vast number of ideas to improve the performance of our models but discarded a lot after evaluating them and getting subpar results. In this section, we are going to list a few of these ideas:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Calculating the perplexity of the model depending on the seen linking word at the beginning of a conclusion/argument 			  for each linking word. This was then used as the linking word embedding or extended the embedding.
	\item Using different classifiers like SVMs or a nearest neighbor classifier using cosine distance.
	\item Standardizing the embeddings to have mean $0$ and standard deviation $1$.
	\item Only using the linking word embeddings for classification instead of concatenating them with the LM embeddings.
	\item Using different LMs.
\end{itemize} 

As already mentioned in the evaluation, we decided not to show the results of some ideas that still had good results, due to the fact that they were too similar to the presented results. Examples for that are additional pretraining, and using RoBERTa instead of BERT.
