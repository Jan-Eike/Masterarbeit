\subsection{Motivation}
\subsection{Task}
The main goal of this thesis is to determine whether or not classification performance for certain classification tasks can be improved by creating additional features based on natural language. We are using two classification tasks to evaluate our performance, namely argument validity prediction and argument stance prediction. Former describes the problem of determining whether, given a pair of some text and a conclusion, the conclusion is valid or not. Argument stance prediction is the problem of classifying the stance to a certain topic, given an argument for or against it. \\
